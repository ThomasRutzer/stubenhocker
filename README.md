# stubenhocker - a #wirvsvirushack outcome

I have also joined forces to think about ideas to combat the current covid19 pandemic.
At the end we hacked less but created a concept idea to force people to stay at home when its necessry.

Of course, if this idea might inspire you, its free to use in all parts.
